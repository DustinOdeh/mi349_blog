        <h2 style="text-align:center">Which Gaming Console Should I Choose?</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center"><em>October 6th, 2020</em> By <b>Dustin Odeh</b></p>
        <p style="text-align:center">If you're asking yourself this question then fear no more because I have great news for you! I myself have tried all systems: (Nintendo Switch, Microsoft Xbox Series, Sony Playstation Series, and PC Gaming). I would like to state that I do enjoy playing all of these systems and my opinion will not be biased whatsoever. With that being said, let's get into it:</p>
        <ul style="text-align:center">
            <li>Nintendo - Great for nintendo exclusive fans who also enjoy when a console has beautiful graphics and runs very smoothly. Mostly optimized for singleplayer console, lacks fun when with other friends online and within its social aspects, although a really great "couch party" console.</li>
            <li>Microsoft - Great for xbox exclusive fans who enjoy breathtaking graphics, if your friends play on this console I suggest getting it, single player is also a great aspect of this console, although sony has more exclusives.</li>
            <li>Sony - Exactly the same as the xbox, if your friends play on this system then get it. The playstation consoles excel at having great exclusives for singleplayer,  but their multpilayer is essentially the same as Microsoft's.</li>
            <li>PC - So I have a GTX 1070 graphics card and it definitely provides optimized graphics, but in my opinion it's not much different than the consoles up to par etc. (Sony, Microsoft).</li>
        </ul>
        <p style="text-align:center">At the end of the day: If you play single player then get the system that has the games you want to play. If you play multiplayer then get the system that your friends play on or people that you know already have. I have no intent on changing your decision, this was primarily for those who have not formed a decision towards the gaming consoles yet.</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center">Why You Should Desire Italian Food</h2>
        <p style="text-align:center"><em>October 6th, 2020</em> By <b>Dustin Odeh</b></p>

            My most savory dishes originate from the Italians and I long await to go to Italy one day. (Thank COVID-19 for my delay). From one of the most eaten foods across the world, pizza, to an even greater well known food, pasta, those two foods should be enough to get your mouth watering. I personally eat pasta often because my mom would make it a lot for my siblings and I. With the proper seasonings and some ground beef and cheese, and maybe some creamy vodka sauce instead of the traditional marinara, it would be a golden dish of pasta. There are so many types of pasta and ways to change the traditional dish of noodles and sauce. The ones that I've had include: rigatoni, farfalle, penne, lasagna, spaghetti, and elbow. Personally, rigatoni is my favorite type of pasta to eat. I love the round and soft shape of the noodle because it is wider than most noodles and holds a lot of sauce. Lasagna is another one of my personal favorites. I top that with ground beef and diced onions and lots of cheese in order to make a proper meal. I also eat Pizza quite often, my fraternity last year lived near a Domino's so I would usually go get a medium 2-topping pizza from them whenever I was in the area. The toppings are absolutely scrumptious I would get banana peppers on one half, pepperoni on the whole, and bacon on the other half in order to still fit the 2-topping margin. My friends would get other sauces like alfredo sauce and put chicken and jalapenos as their toppings. Some people decide to get the most disgusting toppings in my opinion like anchovies and maybe green peppers I hate those. Although, anyone should be able to choose whatever toppings they desire. To get back on track, the Italians created gelato as well, one of my most favorite desserts! There are so many flavors to choose from and boy I bet it tastes even better from the creators themselves in Italy. I had gelato in Michigan at a place near my house and it tasted phenomenal, I highly recommend it. It was cookies and cream and my sister got a tart flavor. She enjoyed her gelato just as much as I did. It was a very fun bonding experience between my sister and I, plus there was delicious ice cream! Did I not mention that gelato is also healthier for you than ice cream yet?! Well it is! If this isn't enough information for you to start switching your kitchen around to the Italian theme, then idk what is. Go out and buy the ingredients needed to make your favorite Italian dish today!
